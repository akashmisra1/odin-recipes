        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of milk</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>pinch of pepper</li>
            <li>2 tsp of butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>BEAT eggs, milk, salt and pepper in medium bowl until blended.</li>
            <li>HEAT butter in large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot. POUR in egg mixture. As eggs begin to set, gently PULL the eggs across the pan with a spatula, forming large soft curds.</li>
            <li>CONTINUE cooking—pulling, lifting and folding eggs—until thickened and no visible liquid egg remains. Do not stir constantly. REMOVE from heat. SERVE immediately.</li>
